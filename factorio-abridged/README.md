# Factorio Abridged: Factorio for busy people

Gee, these rocket launch instructions sure are complicated! What if we just... skipped a few steps here and there.

 * Version 0.0.7
 * Initial release: 2023-07-01
 * Current release: 2023-07-23

This is an overhaul mod that plays like Factorio, but shorter, in several ways. The tech tree and recipes have been re-designed; I have tried to capture the feel of the original while cutting out anything inessential. Not megabase friendly! Most aspects of the game have been simplified, especially oil processing and the late game.

Other changes include terrain generation, tree generation, resource generation, biter generation, ubelts, upipes, stone furnaces, yellow inserters, electric mining drills, beacons, silo and rocket construction, and the rocket launch.

I would recommend turning down biters and turning off cliffs unless you are okay with some frustration.

If you decide to try speedrunning this, let me know!

Tip: Beacons may appear to be completely useless but they are not.

## Mod compatibility

Compatibility with SpaceEx is in progress, as SpaceEx edits some of the abridged research to require space science packs before space science packs can be unlocked. Compatibility with other overhaul mods is untested but hopefully works out of the box (maybe not early-game overhaul mods like IR). Let me know if there are any mods you are interested in compatibility with.

## Known issues

 * Localizations of some tech names
 * Can't research silo when playing with SpaceEx
