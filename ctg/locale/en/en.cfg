[mod-setting-description]
ctg-enable= Uncheck this to disable this mod entirely.
ctg-use-default-water= Uses Factorio's default water generation. Check this if you want the default water in addition to any water generated by this mod. You probably want to leave this option off.
# ctg-water-enable= If disabled, the map will be generated with no water and the remaining water settings will have no effect.
# ctg-water-color= Water can be blue or green. Green water absorbs 5/6 as much pollution as blue water.
ctg-pattern-preset= Choose which terrain generation pattern you would like to use. See the example screenshots for an idea of what each of the suggested options generates. Or, use "custom" to program your own terrain generation pattern below.
ctg-pattern-custom= If you chose "custom" above, this setting should be a lua expression that specifies the desired terrain pattern. See the README and examples for details. If your expression is very long, you can use variables called "v1" through "v8" whose values you specify below.
ctg-pattern-v1= A lua expression whose value will be saved in the variable "v1". You can use "v2" through "v8" here. Leave it as "nil" if you do not need it.
ctg-pattern-v2= A lua expression whose value will be saved in the variable "v2". You can use "v3" through "v8" here. Leave it as "nil" if you do not need it.
ctg-pattern-v3= A lua expression whose value will be saved in the variable "v3". You can use "v4" through "v8" here. Leave it as "nil" if you do not need it.
ctg-pattern-v4= A lua expression whose value will be saved in the variable "v4". You can use "v5" through "v8" here. Leave it as "nil" if you do not need it.
ctg-pattern-v5= A lua expression whose value will be saved in the variable "v5". You can use "v6" through "v8" here. Leave it as "nil" if you do not need it.
ctg-pattern-v6= A lua expression whose value will be saved in the variable "v6". You can use "v7" and "v8" here. Leave it as "nil" if you do not need it.
ctg-pattern-v7= A lua expression whose value will be saved in the variable "v7". You can use "v8" here. Leave it as "nil" if you do not need it.
ctg-pattern-v8= A lua expression whose value will be saved in the variable "v8". Leave it as "nil" if you do not need it.
ctg-seed= If 0, then a random seed will be randomly chosen at the beginning of the game. Otherwise for values 1 to 2^32, specifies a seed for the random number generator. If the same seed is used with the same settings, then the same map will be generated. (If in doubt, just use 0.)
ctg-initial-landfill= If enabled, start the game with a steel chest filled with landfill.
ctg-force-initial-water= Creates a puddle next to the origin
ctg-big-scan= Testing feature: Scan a large area at the beginning of the game
ctg-screenshot= Testing feature: Take a screenshot of the map (use included python script)
ctg-screenshot-zoom= Testing feature: Take a zoomed screenshot of the map (use included python script). Can be slow!
