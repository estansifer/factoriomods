# Heavy Inventory

This mod changes the player's walking speed based on the player's inventory.

When the inventory is full, the player walks 0.5 times the normal speed. When
the inventory is empty, the player walks 1.5 times the normal speed. Partial
stacks of items have less effect than a full stack.
